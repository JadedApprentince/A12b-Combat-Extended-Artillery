Combat Extended Artillery (CEA) Contrubuting Guidelines

Submission of bug reports
The submission of bugs should be posted here on Github with the following:
- A description or summary of what the bug is, what it does, etc.
- Technical information for viewing that shows the problem. This is typically
  a photo or section of code that shows the actual bug in effect whenever possible.
- Mods, if any, that you were using with Combat Extended and Combat Extended Artillery.
- Any other important information that may aid in solving the problem.

Submission of content ideas, code, etc.
I do not mind if you submit content ideas for this mod, but its important to keep in mind 
the following guidelines for submitting content:
- What kind of submission do you have? Is it just an idea, or does it include code or other data to help construct it?
- Does it fit in with Rimworld and Combat Extended Artillery from a gameplay and artistic perspective.
- Has it already been submitted or in the works? Make sure you check to see if something has already not been submitted.

Following these guidelines as they evolve and change will help keep problems to a minimum if any at all, as well as keeping
the place organized and tidy. No one likes a lazy colonist after all.
