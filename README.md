# A12b - Combat Extended Artillery
Version: 0.13 "Anti-tank"  
A simple mod designed to add onto Combat Extended with the addition of new emplaced cannons. 
This adds a 50mm, 75mm, and 105mm cannon to the security tab that are similar to the stock 90mm cannons with their own uses.  
50mm cannons have access to APHE, HE, and APCR shells, just like the 75mm cannon, while the 105mm cannon has access to a powerful HE shell. Each cannon is different and even in late game they can still be useful to some degree. Credit goes primarily to the CE Team for the basis of this code, any other credit can be found on the ludeon forums post.
